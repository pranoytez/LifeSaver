    <string name="about_info">Blood Bank Android App is a life saving initiative, giving every Android smart phone user a chance to be a hero by donating blood. Basically the idea is if a smart phone and internet can help us to share various photographs, videos and text immediately to our well wishers, friends, family members, then why can not we share Blood through this. Basic idea behind this application is sharing of blood, that is whenever we require a blood in any case of emergency within span of minutes you should be able to reach to multiple users mentioning that you in urgent need of blood.Thus with this simple mobile application with innovative idea, you can get in contact of multiple people at a same time when ever you are in need of Blood. This is an online platform where donors and recipients or patients could meet together. It is our desire to use the advent of the internet to help the common people and it is simply an effort to bridge the gap between the donors and patients who are in dire need of help.
In this app user has to create an account with unique username and password. Then he can search for the blood donor on the basis of blood group and city location whenever he requires. Users can also provide the details of their blood group and current location so that he can be searched by the others recipients.
